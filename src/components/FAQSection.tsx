    question: "Will I get access to class recordings?",
    answer: "Yes! All live sessions are automatically recorded and available in your personal dashboard within 2 hours. You get lifetime access to these recordings, so you can review concepts anytime. The recordings include chat conversations and screen sharing for complete context."
  }, {
    question: "Can I attend classes from mobile/tablet?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Our platform is fully optimized for mobile devices. You can attend live classes, access recordings, download materials, and even take quizzes from your smartphone or tablet. Many of our students prefer mobile learning during commutes."
  }, {
    question: "What if I miss some live classes?",
    answer: "No worries! Every session is recorded and available immediately. Plus, we conduct weekend doubt-clearing sessions where you can ask questions about missed content. Our support team also provides 1-on-1 catch-up sessions if needed."
  }, {
    question: "Do I need any IT background to learn Oracle SCM?",
    answer: "Not at all! Our curriculum is designed for complete beginners. We start with basic Oracle concepts and gradually build up to advanced SCM modules. 60% of our successful students came from non-IT backgrounds like HR, Finance, Mechanical Engineering, etc."
  }, {
    question: "How does the payment process work?",
    answer: "You first attend our 3-day free preview classes without paying anything. Only if you're satisfied with the quality and teaching methodology, you pay for the full course. We accept all payment methods including EMI options starting from â‚¹2,999/month."
  }, {
    question: "What's the difference between Self-Paced and Live Training?",
    answer: "Self-Paced gives you pre-recorded videos and basic support. Live Training includes real-time interaction with trainers, doubt clearing, live projects, placement assistance, and community access. 85% of our students choose Live Training for better career outcomes."
  }, {
    question: "Do you provide job placement guarantee?",
    answer: "We provide dedicated placement assistance with our Live Training package. While we can't legally guarantee jobs, we have a 92% placement success rate. Our team actively connects you with hiring partners and provides interview preparation until you get placed."
  }, {
    question: "Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer a 7-day money-back guarantee after your payment. If you're not satisfied with the course quality within the first week, we'll refund 100% of your fees, no questions asked. However, less than 2% of students request refunds."
